happy new year!                                                                                                                             ....senator schumer, more than a year longer than any other administration in history. these are people who have been approved by committees and all others, yet schumer continues to hold them back from serving their country! very unfair!heads of countries are calling wanting to know why senator schumer is not approving their otherwise approved ambassadors!? likewise in government lawyers and others are being delayed at a record pace! 360 great and hardworking people are waiting for approval from....its incredible how democrats can all use their ridiculous sound bite and say that a wall doesnt work. it does, and properly built, almost 100%! they say its old technology - but so is the wheel. they now say it is immoral- but it is far more immoral for people to be dying!im in the oval office. democrats, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for border security, including the wall. you voted yes in 2006 and 2013. one more yes, but with me in office, ill get it built, and fast!im in the oval office. democrats, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for border security, including the wall. you voted yes in 2006 and 3013. one more yes, but with me in office, ill get it built, and fast!i am the only person in america who could say that, im bringing our great troops back home, with victory, and get bad press. it is fake news and pundits who have failed for years that are doing the complaining. if i stayed in endless wars forever, they would still be unhappy!i campaigned on border security, which you cannot have without a strong and powerful wall. our southern border has long been an open wound, where drugs, criminals (including human traffickers) and illegals would pour into our country. dems should get back here an fix now!.....except the results are far better than i ever said they were going to be! i campaigned against the never ending wars, remember!        ...i campaigned on getting out of syria and other places. now when i start getting out the fake news media, or some failed generals who were unable to do the job before i arrived, like to complain about me & my tactics, which are working. just doing what i said i was going to do!if anybody but donald trump did what i did in syria, which was an isis loaded mess when i became president, they would be a national hero. isis is mostly gone, were slowly sending our troops back home to be with their families, while at the same time fighting isis remnants......an all concrete wall was never abandoned, as has been reported by the media. some areas will be all concrete but the experts at border patrol prefer a wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides). makes sense to me!president and mrs. obama built/has a ten foot wall around their d.c. mansion/compound. i agree, totally necessary for their safety and security. the u.s. needs the same thing, slightly larger version!great work by my administration over the holidays to save coast guard pay during this #schumershutdown. no thanks to the democrats who left town and are not concerned about the safety and security of americans!veterans on president trumps handling of border security - 62% approval rating. on being a strong leader - 59%.  ap poll. thank you!        it turns out to be true now, that the department of justice and the fbi, under president obama, rigged the investigation for hillary and really turned the screws on trump, and now it looks like in a corrupt & illegal way. the facts are out now. whole hoax exposed. @jessebwattersabsolutely nothing (on russian collusion). kimberley strassel, the wall street journal. the russian collusion fabrication is the greatest hoax in the history of american politics. the only russian collusion was with hillary and the democrats!2018 is being called the year of the worker by steve moore, co-author of trumponomics. it was indeed a great year for the american worker with the best job market in 50 years, and the lowest unemployment rate ever for blacks and hispanics and all workers. big wage gains.for those that naively ask why didnt the republicans get approval to build the wall over the last year, it is because in the senate we need 10 democrat votes, and they will gives us none for border security! now we have to do it the hard way, with a shutdown. too bad! @foxnews...children in question were very sick before they were given over to border patrol. the father of the young girl said it was not their fault, he hadnt given her water in days. border patrol needs the wall and it will all end. they are working so hard & getting so little credit!any deaths of children or others at the border are strictly the fault of the democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally. they cant. if we had a wall, they wouldnt even try! the two.....just had a long and very good call with president xi of china. deal is moving along very well. if made, it will be very comprehensive, covering all subjects, areas and points of dispute. big progress being made!i am in the white house waiting for the democrats to come on over and make a deal on border security. from what i hear, they are spending so much time on presidential harassment that they have little time left for things like stopping crime and our military!the mueller angry democrats recently deleted approximately 19,000 text messages between fbi agent lisa page and her lover, agent peter s. these texts were asked for and invaluable to the truth of the witch hunt hoax. this is a total obstruction of justice. all texts demanded!thank you to sean parnell for the nice comments on @foxandfriends about the troops wonderful reaction to melania and i in iraq and germany. great things are happening!.....honduras, guatemala and el salvador are doing nothing for the united states but taking our money. word is that a new caravan is forming in honduras and they are doing nothing about it. we will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of u.s. for years!.....close the southern border. bring our car industry back into the united states where it belongs. go back to pre-nafta, before so many of our companies and jobs were so foolishly sent to mexico. either we build (finish) the wall or we close the border..........the united states looses soooo much money on trade with mexico under nafta, over 75 billion dollars a year (not including drug money which would be many times that amount), that i would consider closing the southern border a profit making operation. we build a wall or.....we will be forced to close the southern border entirely if the obstructionist democrats do not give us the money to finish the wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our country is saddled with. hard to believe there was a congress & president who would approve!cnn & others within the fake news universe were going wild about my signing maga hats for our military in iraq and germany. if these brave young people ask me to sign their hat, i will sign. can you imagine my saying no? we brought or gave no hats as the fake news first reported!this isnt about the wall, everybody knows that a wall will work perfectly (in israel the wall works 99.9%). this is only about the dems not letting donald trump & the republicans have a win. they may have the 10 senate votes, but we have the issue, border security. 2020!brad blakeman: the american people understand that we have been played by foreign actors who would rather have us fight their battles for them. the president says look, this is your neighborhood, youve got to stand up to protect yourselves. dont always look to america.brad blakeman: the american people understand that we have been played by foreign actors who would rather have us fight their battles for them. the pesident says look, this is your neighborhood, youve got to stand up to protect yourselves. dont always look to america.i totally agree!                                                                                                                            there is right now a full scale manhunt going on in california for an illegal immigrant accused of shooting and killing a police officer during a traffic stop. time to get tough on border security. build the wall!border patrol agents want the wall. democrats say they dont want the wall (even though they know it is really needed), and they dont want ice. they dont have much to campaign on, do they? an open southern border and the large scale crime that comes with such stupidity!the reason the daca for wall deal didnt get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the 9th circuit allowed daca to remain, thereby setting up a supreme court case. after ruling, dems dropped deal - and thats where we are today, democrat obstruction of the needed wall.the democrats obstruction of the desperately needed wall, where they almost all recently agreed it should be built, is exceeded only by their obstruction of 350 great people wanting & expecting to come into government after being delayed for more than two years, a u.s. record!the reason the daca for wall deal didnt get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the 9th circuit allowed daca to remain, thereby setting up a supteme court case. after ruling, dems dropped deal - and thats where we are today, democrat obstruction of the needed wall.have the democrats finally realized that we desperately need border security and a wall on the southern border. need to stop drugs, human trafficking,gang members & criminals from coming into our country. do the dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are democrats?just returned from visiting our troops in iraq and germany. one thing is certain, we have incredible people representing our country - people that know how to win!.@flotus melania and i were honored to visit our incredible troops at al asad air base in iraq. god bless the u.s.a.!                       i hope everyone, even the fake news media, is having a great christmas! our country is doing very well. we are securing our borders, making great new trade deals, and bringing our troops back home. we are finally putting america first. merry christmas!  #magamerry christmas!

@potus and i enjoyed working with  i am in the oval office & just gave out a 115 mile long contract for another large section of the wall in texas. we are already building and renovating many miles of wall, some complete. democrats must end shutdown and finish funding. billions of dollars, & lives, will be saved!christmas eve briefing with my team working on north korea  progress being made. looking forward to my next summit with chairman kim!       i am all alone (poor me) in the white house waiting for the democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed border security. at some point the democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our country more money than the border wall we are all talking about. crazy!saudi arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild syria, instead of the united states. see? isnt it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a great country, the u.s., that is 5000 miles away. thanks to saudi a!the wall is different than the 25 billion dollars in border security. the complete wall will be built with the shutdown money plus funds already in hand. the reporting has been inaccurate on the point. the problem is, without the wall, much of the rest of dollars are wasted!i never lashed out at the acting attorney general of the u.s., a man for whom i have great respect. this is a made up story, one of many, by the fake news media!the only problem our economy has is the fed. they dont have a feel for the market, they dont understand necessary trade wars or strong dollars or even democrat shutdowns over borders. the fed is like a powerful golfer who cant score because he has no touch - he cant putt!america is respected again!                                                                                                                 for all of the sympathizers out there of brett mcgurk remember, he was the obama appointee who was responsible for loading up airplanes with 1.8 billion dollars in cash &  sending it to iran as part of the horrific iran nuclear deal (now terminated) approved by little bob corker.....we are substantially subsidizing the militaries of many very rich countries all over the world, while at the same time these countries take total advantage of the u.s., and our taxpayers, on trade. general mattis did not see this as a problem. i do, and it is being fixed!to those few senators who think i dont like or appreciate being allied with other countries, they are wrong, i do. what i dont like, however, is when many of these same countries take advantage of their friendship with the united states, both in military protection and trade...virtually every democrat we are dealing with today strongly supported a border wall or fence. it was only when i made it an important part of my campaign, because people and drugs were pouring into our country unchecked, that they turned against it. desperately needed!president @rt_erdogan of turkey has very strongly informed me that he will eradicate whatever is left of isis in syria....and he is a man who can do it plus, turkey is right next door. our troops are coming home!the president has been remarkable. i do not doubt that he will thrive in this new environment, and he will be a constant reminder of what populism is. thank you to tammy bruce and steve hilton. presidential harassment has been with me from the beginning!the most important way to stop gangs, drugs, human trafficking and massive crime is at our southern border. we need border security, and as everyone knows, you cant have border security without a wall. the drones & technology are just bells and whistles. safety for america!mitch mcconnell just told a group of people, and me, that he has been in the u.s. senate for 32 years and the last two have been by far the best & most productive of his career. tax & regulation cuts, va choice, farm bill, criminal justice reform, judgeships & much more. great!it should not be the job of america to replace regimes around the world. this is what president trump recognized in iraq, that it was the biggest foreign policy disaster of the last several decades, and hes right...the generals still dont get the mistake.  @randpaulrt @rsscott_bp252: usbp agents will continue to diligently do their sworn duites through the holidays and the furlough -just like every oth thanks @randpaul  i am very proud of the president. this is exactly what he promised, and i think the people agree with him. weve been at war too long and in too many places...spent several trillion dollars on these wars everywhere. hes different...thats why he got elected......bob corker was responsible for giving us the horrible iran nuclear deal, which i ended, yet he badmouths me for wanting to bring our young people safely back home. bob wanted to run and asked for my endorsement. i said no and the game was over. #maga i love tennessee!senator bob corker just stated that, im so priveledged to serve in the senate for twelve years, and thats what i told the people of our state thats what id do, serve for two terms. but that is not true - wanted to run but poll numbers tanked when i wouldnt endorse him.....we signed two pieces of major legislation this week, criminal justice reform and the farm bill. these are two big deals, but all the fake news media wants to talk about is the mistake of bringing our young people back home from the never ending wars. it all began 19 years ago!unthinkable devastation from the tsunami disaster in indonesia. more than two hundred dead and nearly a thousand injured or unaccounted for. we are praying for recovery and healing. america is with you!i just had a long and productive call with president @rt_erdogan of turkey. we discussed isis, our mutual involvement in syria, & the slow & highly coordinated pullout of u.s. troops from the area. after many years they are coming home. we also discussed heavily expanded trade.i am pleased to announce that our very talented deputy secretary of defense, patrick shanahan, will assume the title of acting secretary of defense starting january 1, 2019. patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as deputy, & previously boeing. he will be great!the only way to stop drugs, gangs, human trafficking, criminal elements and much else from coming into our country is with a wall or barrier. drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned wall that works!when president obama ingloriously fired jim mattis, i gave him a second chance. some thought i shouldnt, i thought i should. interesting relationship-but i also gave all of the resources that he never really had. allies are very important-but not when they take advantage of u.s.if anybody but your favorite president, donald j. trump, announced that, after decimating isis in syria, we were going to bring our troops back home (happy & healthy), that person would be the most popular hero in america. with me, hit hard instead by the fake news media. crazy!brett mcgurk, who i do not know, was appointed by president obama in 2015. was supposed to leave in february but he just resigned prior to leaving. grandstander? the fake news is making such a big deal about this nothing event!i will not be going to florida because of the shutdown - staying in the white house!  #maga                                                 senate adjourns until december 27th.                                                                                                        i won an election, said to be one of the greatest of all time, based on getting out of endless & costly foreign wars & also based on strong borders which will keep our country safe. we fight for the borders of other countries, but we wont fight for the borders of our own!the crisis of illegal activity at our southern border is real and will not stop until we build a great steel barrier or wall. let work begin!will be having lunch in white house residence with large group concerning border security.                                                  ....going to be there for three months, and that was seven years ago - we never left. when i became president, isis was going wild. now isis is largely defeated and other local countries, including turkey, should be able to easily take care of whatever remains. were coming home!i am in the white house, working hard. news reports concerning the shutdown and syria are mostly fake. we are negotiating with the democrats on desperately needed border security (gangs, drugs, human trafficking & more) but it could be a long stay. on syria, we were originally...rt @realdonaldtrump: our great country must have border security!                                                                           our great country must have border security!                                                                                                wishing supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg a full and speedy recovery!                                                               some of the many bills that i am signing in the oval office right now. cancelled my trip on air force one to florida while we wait to see if the democrats will help us to protect americas southern border! a design of our steel slat barrier which is totally effective while at the same time beautiful!                                             today, it was my honor to sign into law h.r. 7213, the countering weapons of mass destruction act of 2018. the act redesignates the @dhsgov domestic nuclear detection office as the countering weapons of mass destruction office. read more:  today, it was my great honor to sign the #firststepact - a monumental bi-partisan win for the american people!                              ive done more damage to isis than all recent presidents....not even close!                                                                  the democrats now own the shutdown!                                                                                                         general anthony tata, author, dark winter. i think the president is making the exact right move in syria. all the geniuses who are protesting the withdrawal of troops from syria are the same geniuses who cooked the books on isis intelligence and gave rise to isis.there has never been a president who has been tougher (but fair) on china or russia - never, just look at the facts. the fake news tries so hard to paint the opposite picture.thank you @stevedaines for being willing to go with the so-called nuclear option in order to win on desperately needed border security! have my total support.mitch, use the nuclear option and get it done! our country is counting on you!                                                              even president ronald reagan tried for 8 years to build a border wall, or fence, and was unable to do so. others also have tried. we will get it done, one way or the other!shutdown today if democrats do not vote for border security!                                                                                house republican vote, 217-185.                                                                                                             the democrats, whose votes we need in the senate, will probably vote against border security and the wall even though they know it is desperately needed. if the dems vote no, there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time. people dont want open borders and crime!no matter what happens today in the senate, republican house members should be very proud of themselves. they flew back to washington from all parts of the world in order to vote for border security and the wall. not one democrat voted yes, and we won big. i am very proud of you!.....on a border is only effective in conjunction with a wall. properly designed and built walls work, and the democrats are lying when they say they dont. in israel the wall is 99.9% successful. will not be any different on our southern border! hundreds of $billions saved!the democrats are trying to belittle the concept of a wall, calling it old fashioned. the fact is there is nothing elses that will work, and that has been true for thousands of years. its like the wheel, there is nothing better. i know tech better than anyone, & technology.....senator mitch mcconnell should fight for the wall and border security as hard as he fought for anything. he will need democrat votes, but as shown in the house, good things happen. if enough dems dont vote, it will be a democrat shutdown! house republicans were great yesterday!soon to be speaker nancy pelosi said, last week live from the oval office, that the republicans didnt have the votes for border security. today the house republicans voted and won, 217-185. nancy does not have to apologize. all i want is great border security!thank you to our great republican members of congress for your vote to fund border security and the wall. the final numbers were 217-185 and many have said that the enthusiasm was greater than they have ever seen before. so proud of you all. now on to the senate!....equipment. general mattis was a great help to me in getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations. a new secretary of defense will be named shortly. i greatly thank jim for his service!general jim mattis will be retiring, with distinction, at the end of february, after having served my administration as secretary of defense for the past two years. during jims tenure, tremendous progress has been made, especially with respect to the purchase of new fighting....democrats, it is time to come together and put the safety of the american people before politics. border security must become a #1 priority! farm bill signing in 15 minutes! #emmys #tbt                                                                                                so hard to believe that lindsey graham would be against saving soldier lives & billions of $$$. why are we fighting for our enemy, syria, by staying & killing isis for them, russia, iran & other locals? time to focus on our country & bring our youth back home where they belong!congress just passed the criminal justice reform bill known as the #firststepact. congratulations! this is a great bi-partisan achievement for everybody. when both parties work together we can keep our country safer. a wonderful thing for the u.s.a.!!when i begrudgingly signed the omnibus bill, i was promised the wall and border security by leadership. would be done by end of year (now). it didnt happen! we foolishly fight for border security for other countries - but not for our beloved u.s.a. not good!rt @realdonaldtrump: after historic victories against isis, its time to bring our great young people home!                                  with so much talk about the wall, people are losing sight of the great job being done on our southern border by border patrol, ice and our great military. remember the caravans? well, they didnt get through and none are forming or on their way. border is tight. fake news silent!the democrats, who know steel slats (wall) are necessary for border security, are putting politics over country. what they are just beginning to realize is that i will not sign any of their legislation, including infrastructure, unless it has perfect border security. u.s.a. wins!....russia, iran, syria & many others are not happy about the u.s. leaving, despite what the fake news says, because now they will have to fight isis and others, who they hate, without us. i am building by far the most powerful military in the world. isis hits us they are doomed!does the usa want to be the policeman of the middle east, getting nothing but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who, in almost all cases, do not appreciate what we are doing? do we want to be there forever? time for others to finally fight.....getting out of syria was no surprise. ive been campaigning on it for years, and six months ago, when i very publicly wanted to do it, i agreed to stay longer. russia, iran, syria & others are the local enemy of isis. we were doing there work. time to come home & rebuild. #magaim proud of the president today to hear that he is declaring victory in syria. senator rand paul.  i couldnt agree more with the presidents decision. by definition, this is the opposite of an obama decision. senator mike leetrump gets no credit for what hes done in the middle east.  @ingrahamangle  so true, thank you laura!                                       col. jim carafano on @ingrahamangle trump has made the middle east a better place. when trump came into office, isis was running amuck in the middle east. over a million refugees poured into western europe - none of that is happening today. thats all due to trump.rt @govmikehuckabee: it took a british court to reveal it, but more shocking evidence of the real "russian collusion" and it wasn't about @ after historic victories against isis, its time to bring our great young people home!                                                       ....in any event, it goes on and on & the new ag, who is now being replaced by yet another ag (who openly campaigned on a get trump agenda), does little else but rant, rave & politic against me. will never be treated fairly by these people - a total double standard of justice....sleazebag ag eric schneiderman, who has since resigned over horrific women abuse, when i wanted to close the foundation so as not to be in conflict with politics. shady eric was head of new yorkers for clinton, and refused to even look at the corrupt clinton foundation......the trump foundation has done great work and given away lots of money, both mine and others, to great charities over the years - with me taking no fees, rent, salaries etc. now, as usual, i am getting slammed by cuomo and the dems in a long running civil lawsuit started by.....we have defeated isis in syria, my only reason for being there during the trump presidency.                                                 mexico is paying (indirectly) for the wall through the new usmca, the replacement for nafta! far more money coming to the u.s. because of the tremendous dangers at the border, including large scale criminal and drug inflow, the united states military will build the wall!in our country, so much money has been poured down the drain, for so many years, but when it comes to border security and the military, the democrats fight to the death. we won on the military, which is being completely rebuilt. one way or the other, we will win on the wall!in our country, so much money has been poured down the drain, for so many years, but the democrats fight us like cats and dogs when it comes to spending on boarder security (including a wall) and the military. we won on the military, it is being completely rebuilt. we will win.......this

law!america is the greatest country in the world and my job is to fight for all citizens, even those who have made mistakes. congratulations to the senate on the bi-partisan passing of a historic criminal justice reform bill........it will be beautiful and, at the same time, give our country the security that our citizens deserve. it will go up fast and save us billions of dollars a month once completed!the democrats, are saying loud and clear that they do not want to build a concrete wall - but we are not building a concrete wall, we are building artistically designed steel slats, so that you can easily see through it....congratulations to @marthamcsally on her appointment by governor @dougducey as the great new senator from arizona - i have no doubt she will do a fantastic job!president donald j. trumps commission on school safety examined ways to make our schools safe for all students and teachers. read more:     rt @vp: today, @potus trump will direct the

@flotus are seen saturday, december 15, i michael isikoff was the first to report dossier allegations and now seriously doubts the dossier claims. the whole russian collusion thing was a hoax, but who is going to restore the good name of so many people whose reputations have been destroyed?....will never be proven and are likely false.  thank you to michael isikoff, yahoo, for honesty. what this means is that the fisa warrants and the whole russian witch hunt is a fraud and a hoax which should be ended immediately. also, it was paid for by crooked hillary & dnc!russia dossier reporter now doubts dopey christopher steeles claims! when you get into the details of the steele dossier, the specific allegations, we have not seen the evidence to support them. theres good grounds to think that some of the more sensational allegations.....illegal immigration costs the united states more than 200 billion dollars a year. how was this allowed to happen?                           facebook, twitter and google are so biased toward the dems it is ridiculous! twitter, in fact, has made it much more difficult for people to join @realdonaldtrump. they have removed many names & greatly slowed the level and speed of increase. they have acknowledged-done nothing!i hope the people over at the fed will read todays wall street journal editorial before they make yet another mistake. also, dont let the market become any more illiquid than it already is. stop with the 50 bs. feel the market, dont just go by meaningless numbers. good luck!good luck today in court to general michael flynn. will be interesting to see what he has to say, despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about russian collusion in our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign. there was no collusion!biggest outrage yet in the long, winding and highly conflicted mueller witch hunt is the fact that 19,000 demanded text messages between peter strzok and his fbi lover, lisa page, were purposely & illegally deleted. would have explained whole hoax, which is now under protest!today i am making good on my promise to defend our farmers & ranchers from unjustified trade retaliation by foreign nations. i have authorized secretary perdue to implement the 2nd round of market facilitation payments. our economy is stronger than everwe stand with our farmers!rt @whitehouse: on december 17, 1903, the first successful flight of wilbur and orville wright's handcrafted biplane ushered in the age of  anytime you hear a democrat saying that you can have good border security without a wall, write them off as just another politician following the party line. time for us to save billions of dollars a year and have, at the same time, far greater safety and control!it is incredible that with a very strong dollar and virtually no inflation, the outside world blowing up around us, paris is burning and china way down, the fed is even considering yet another interest rate hike. take the victory!anytime you hear a democrat saying that you can have good boarder security without a wall, write them off as just another politician following the party line. time for us to save billions of dollars a year and have, at the same time, far greater safety and control!the deductible which comes with obamacare is so high that it is practically not even useable! hurts families badly. we have a chance, working with the democrats, to deliver great healthcare! a confirming supreme court decision will lead to great healthcare results for americans!....the russian witch hunt hoax, started as the insurance policy long before i even got elected, is very bad for our country. they are entrapping people for misstatements, lies or unrelated things that took place many years ago. nothing to do with collusion. a democrat scam!....a persecution of the president.  daniel henninger, the wall street journal. thank you, people are starting to see and understand what this witch hunt is all about. jeff sessions should be ashamed of himself for allowing this total hoax to get started in the first place!it looks here as though general flynns defenses are incidental to something larger which is for the prosecution to figure out if it can find a path to donald trump without quite knowing what that crime might be. it stops looking like prosecution and more looking like......required television watching is last weeks @marthamaccallum interview with the wonderful wife of rod blagojevich and the @trish_regan interview with a jerome corsi. if that doesnt tell you something about what has been going on in our country, nothing will. very sad!required television watching is last weeks @marthamaccallum interview with the wonderful wife of @rodblagojevich and the @trishregan interview with a jerome corsi. if that doesnt tell you something about what has been going on in our country, nothing will. very sad!the democrats policy of child seperation on the border during the obama administration was far worse than the way we handle it now. remember the 2014 picture of children in cages - the obama years. however, if you dont separate, far more people will come. smugglers use the kids!judge ken starr, former solicitor generel & independent counsel, just stated that, after two years, there is no evidence or proof of collusion & further that there is no evidence that there was a campaign financing violation involving the president. thank you judge. @foxnewsat the request of many, i will be reviewing the case of a u.s. military hero, major matt golsteyn, who is charged with murder. he could face the death penalty from our own government after he admitted to killing a terrorist bomb maker while overseas. @petehegseth @foxnewsremember, michael cohen only became a rat after the fbi did something which was absolutely unthinkable & unheard of until the witch hunt was illegally started. they broke into an attorneys office! why didnt they break into the dnc to get the server, or crookeds office?so where are all the missing text messages between fired fbi agents peter s and the lovely lisa page, his lover. just reported that they have been erased and wiped clean. what an outrage as the totally compromised and conflicted witch hunt moves ever so slowly forward. want them!a real scandal is the one sided coverage, hour by hour, of networks like nbc & democrat spin machines like saturday night live. it is all nothing less than unfair news coverage and dem commercials. should be tested in courts, cant be legal? only defame & belittle! collusion?wow, 19,000 texts between lisa page and her lover, peter s of the fbi, in charge of the russia hoax, were just reported as being wiped clean and gone. such a big story that will never be covered by the fake news. witch hunt!the pathetic and dishonest weekly standard, run by failed prognosticator bill kristol (who, like many others, never had a clue), is flat broke and out of business. too bad. may it rest in peace!never in the history of our country has the press been more dishonest than it is today. stories that should be good, are bad. stories that should be bad, are horrible. many stories, like with the real story on russia, clinton & the dnc, seldom get reported. too bad!.......the trump administration will be announcing the new secretary of the interior next week.                                             secretary of the interior @ryanzinke will be leaving the administration at the end of the year after having served for a period of almost two years. ryan has accomplished much during his tenure and i want to thank him for his service to our nation.......wow, but not surprisingly, obamacare was just ruled unconstitutional by a highly respected judge in texas. great news for america!          as i predicted all along, obamacare has been struck down as an unconstitutional disaster! now congress must pass a strong law that provides great healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions. mitch and nancy, get it done!for the record, there were many people who wanted to be the white house chief of staff. mick m will do a great job!                         ....i look forward to working with him in this new capacity as we continue to make america great again! john will be staying until the end of the year. he is a great patriot and i want to personally thank him for his service!i am pleased to announce that mick mulvaney, director of the office of management & budget, will be named acting white house chief of staff, replacing general john kelly, who has served our country with distinction. mick has done an outstanding job while in the administration....thank you to @tim_cook for agreeing to expand operations in the u.s. and thereby creating thousands of jobs!

our negotiations with north korea - i always reply by saying we are in no hurry, there is wonderful potential for great economic success for that country....china just announced that their economy is growing much slower than anticipated because of our trade war with them. they have just suspended u.s. tariff hikes. u.s. is doing very well. china wants to make a big and very comprehensive deal. it could happen, and rather soon!china just announce the there economy is growing much slower than anticipated because of our trade war with them. they have just suspended u.s. tariff hikes. u.s. is

gave general flynn a great deal because they were embarrassed by the way he was treated - the fbi said he didnt lie and they overrode the fbi. they want to scare everybody into making up stories that are not true by catching them in the smallest of misstatements. sad!..........guilty even on a civil basis. those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence, which he did-including the fact that his family was temporarily let off the hook. as a lawyer, michael has great liability to me!....guilty even on a civil bases. those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence, which he did-including the fact that his family was temporarily let off the hook. as a lawyer, michael has great liability to me!....stated that i did nothing wrong with respect to campaign finance laws, if they even apply, because this was not campaign finance. cohen was guilty on many charges unrelated to me, but he plead to two campaign charges which were not criminal and of which he probably was not...i never directed michael cohen to break the law. he was a lawyer and he is supposed to know the law. it is called advice of counsel, and a lawyer has great liability if a mistake is made. that is why they get paid. despite that many campaign finance lawyers have strongly......i often stated, one way or the other, mexico is going to pay for the wall. this has never changed. our new deal with mexico (and canada), the usmca, is so much better than the old, very costly & anti-usa nafta deal, that just by the money we save, mexico is paying for the wall!.@flotus melania will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight on @foxnews at 9:00pme!                                                        the democrats and president obama gave iran 150 billion dollars and got nothing, but they cant give 5 billion dollars for national security and a wall?another very bad terror attack in france. we are going to strengthen our borders even more. chuck and nancy must give us the votes to get additional border security!thanks to leader mcconnell for agreeing to bring a senate vote on criminal justice this week! these historic changes will make communities safer and save tremendous taxpayers dollars. it brings much needed hope to many families during the holiday season.i dont care what you think of the president...it cannot bleed over to the fbi...comey is confirming there is bias in the fbi... 
-chris sweckerjames comey just totally exposed his partisan stance by urging his fellow democrats to take back the white house in 2020. in other words, he is and has been a democrat. comey had no right heading the fbi at any time, but especially after his mind exploded!fake news has it purposely wrong. many, over ten, are vying for and wanting the white house chief of staff position. why wouldnt someone want one of the truly great and meaningful jobs in washington. please report news correctly. thank you!very productive conversations going on with china! watch for some important announcements!                                                  great job by michael anton on @foxandfriends. a true national security expert!                                                              ....people do not yet realize how much of the wall, including really effective renovation, has already been built. if the democrats do not give us the votes to secure our country, the military will build the remaining sections of the wall. they know how important it is!.....i look forward to my meeting with chuck schumer & nancy pelosi. in 2006, democrats voted for a wall, and they were right to do so. today, they no longer want border security. they will fight it at all cost, and nancy must get votes for speaker. but the wall will get built.......however, for strictly political reasons and because they have been pulled so far left, do not want border security. they want open borders for anyone to come in. this brings large scale crime and disease. our southern border is now secure and will remain that way............ice, border patrol and our military have done a fantastic job of securing our southern border. a great wall would be, however, a far easier & less expensive solution. we have already built large new sections & fully renovated others, making them like new. the democrats,.....despite the large caravans that were forming and heading to our country, people have not been able to get through our newly built walls, makeshift walls & fences, or border patrol officers & military. they are now staying in mexico or going back to their original countries.......former fbi director james comey under fire for his testimony acknowledging he knew that the democrats paid for that phony trump dossier. @loudobbs  details on tuesday night.james comeys behind closed doors testimony reveals that there was not evidence of campaign collusion with russia when he left the fbi. in other words, the witch hunt is illegal and should never have been started!....which it was not (but even if it was, it is only a civil case, like obamas - but it was done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine. lawyers liability if he made a mistake, not me). cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced. witch hunt!democrats cant find a smocking gun tying the trump campaign to russia after james comeys testimony. no smocking gun...no collusion. @foxnews  thats because there was no collusion. so now the dems go to a simple private transaction, wrongly call it a campaign contribution,...i am in the process of interviewing some really great people for the position of white house chief of staff. fake news has been saying with certainty it was nick ayers, a spectacular person who will always be with our #maga agenda. i will be making a decision soon!the trump administration has accomplished more than any other u.s. administration in its first two (not even) years of existence, & we are having a great time doing it! all of this despite the fake news media, which has gone totally out of its mind-truly the enemy of the people!leakin james comey must have set a record for who lied the most to congress in one day. his friday testimony was so untruthful! this whole deal is a rigged fraud headed up by dishonest people who would do anything so that i could not become president. they are now exposed!on 245  occasions, former fbi director james comey told house investigators he didnt know, didnt recall, or couldnt remember things when asked. opened investigations on 4 americans (not 2) - didnt know who signed off and didnt know christopher steele. all lies!it was my honor to attend todays #armynavygame in philadelphia. a great game played all around by our heroes. congratulations @armywp_football on the win!

date of transition to be determined.                    i am pleased to announce my nomination of four-star general mark milley, chief of staff of the united states army  as the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, replacing general joe dunford, who will be retiring....after two years and millions of pages of documents (and a cost of over $30,000,000), no collusion!

 @trish_reganstatement from china: the teams of both sides are now having smooth communications and good cooperation with each other. we are full of confidence that an agreement can be reached within the next 90 days. i agree!does the fake news media ever mention the fact that republicans, with the very important help of my campaign rallies, won the united states senate, 53 to 47? all i hear is that the open border dems won the house. senate alone approves judges & others. big republican win!my thoughts and prayers are with the @usmc crew members who were involved in a mid-air collision off the coast of japan. thank you to @usforcesjapan for their immediate response and rescue efforts. whatever you need, we are here for you. @iiimefwithout the phony russia witch hunt, and with all that we have accomplished in the last almost two years (tax & regulation cuts, judges, military, vets, etc.) my approval rating would be at 75% rather than the 50% just reported by rasmussen. its called presidential harassment!working hard, thank you!

the senate should pass the stop act  and firmly stop this poison from killing our children and destroying our country. no more delay!bruce ohr is at the center of false allegations which led to a multi-million dollar investigation into what apparently didnt happen. darrell issa, house oversight. we can take out the word apparently.  @foxnewswill bruce ohr, whose family received big money for helping to create the phony, dirty and discredited dossier, ever be fired from the jeff sessions  justice department? a total joke!everybody wants to keep their security clearance, its worth great prestige and big dollars, even board seats, and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect brennan. it certainly isnt because of the good job he did! he is a political hack.i hope john brennan, the worst cia director in our countrys history, brings a lawsuit. it will then be very easy to get all of his records, texts, emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did, but how he was involved with the mueller rigged witch hunt. he wont sue!wheres the collusion? they made up a phony crime called collusion, and when there was no collusion they say there was obstruction (of a phony crime that never existed). if you fight back or say anything bad about the rigged witch hunt, they scream obstruction!....looking for trouble. they are enjoying ruining peoples lives and refuse to look at the real corruption on the democrat side - the lies, the firings, the deleted emails and soooo much more! muellers angry dems are looking to impact the election. they are a national disgrace!disgraced and discredited bob mueller and his whole group of angry democrat thugs spent over 30 hours with the white house councel, only with my approval, for purposes of transparency. anybody needing that much time when they know there is no russian collusion is just someone....study the late joseph mccarthy, because we are now in period with mueller and his gang that make joseph mccarthy look like a baby! rigged witch hunt!some members of the media are very angry at the fake story in the new york times. they actually called to complain and apologize - a big step forward. from the day i announced, the times has been fake news, and with their disgusting new board member, it will only get worse!the failing new york times wrote a story that made it seem like the white house councel had turned on the president, when in fact it is just the opposite - & the two fake reporters knew this. this is why the fake news media has become the enemy of the people. so bad for america!no collusion and no obstruction, except by crooked hillary and the democrats. all of the resignations and corruption, yet heavily conflicted bob mueller refuses to even look in that direction. what about the brennan, comey, mccabe, strzok lies to congress, or crookeds emails!....and have demanded transparency so that this rigged and disgusting witch hunt can come to a close. so many lives have been ruined over nothing - mccarthyism at its worst! yet mueller & his gang of dems refuse to look at the real crimes on the other side - media is even worse!the failing @nytimes wrote a fake piece today implying that because white house councel don mcgahn was giving hours of testimony to the special councel, he must be a john dean type rat. but i allowed him and all others to testify - i didnt have to. i have nothing to hide......i allowed white house counsel don mcgahn, and all other requested members of the white house staff, to fully cooperate with the special counsel. in addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents. most transparent in history. no collusion, no obstruction. witch hunt!i allowed white house counsel don mcgahn, and all other requested members of the white house staff, to fully cooperate with the special councel. in addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents. most transparent in history. no collusion, no obstruction. witch hunt!the united states has ended the ridiculous 230 million dollar yearly development payment to syria. saudi arabia and other rich countries in the middle east will start making payments instead of the u.s. i want to develop the u.s., our military and countries that help us!

(poorly) know a windfall when they see it. when asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade, they wanted a number so ridiculously high that i cancelled it. never let someone hold you up! i will instead...how does a politician, cuomo, known for pushing people and businesses out of his state, not to mention having the highest taxes in the u.s., survive making the statement, were not going to make america great again, it was never that great? which section of the sentence is worse?in speaking with some of the worlds top business leaders i asked what it is that would make business (jobs) even better in the u.s. stop quarterly reporting & go to a six month system, said one. that would allow greater flexibility & save money. i have asked the sec to study!.....released in 2017. if his statement is based on intelligence he has seen since leaving office, it constitutes an intelligence breach......  richard burr (r-nc) senate intel cmte chair  @loudobbsdirector brennans recent statements purport to know as fact that the trump campaign colluded with a foreign power. if director brennans statement is based on intelligence he received while leading the cia, why didnt he include it in the intelligence community assessment..........an incredibly corrupt fbi & doj trying to steer the outcome of a presidential election. brennan has gone off the deep end, hes disgraced and discredited himself. his conduct has been outrageous. chris farrell, judicial watch.how can senator richard blumenthal, who went around for twenty years as a connecticut politician bragging that he was a great marine war hero in vietnam (then got caught and sobbingly admitted he was neither a marine nor ever in vietnam), pass judgement on anyone? loser!.@tuckercarlson speaking of john brennan: how did somebody so obviously limited intellectually get to be cia director in the first place? now that is a really good question! then followed by richard blumenthal of connecticut is a fake war hero... so true, a total fake!very concerned about comeys firing, afraid they will be exposed, said bruce ohr. dojs emails & notes show bruce ohrs connection to (phony & discredited) trump dossier. a creep thinking he would get caught in a dishonest act. rigged witch hunt!while steele shopped the document to multiple media outlets, he also asked for help with a russian oligarch.  catherine herridge of @foxnews  @loudobbs  in other words, they were colluding with russia!the fbi received documents from bruce ohr (of the justice department & whose wife nelly worked for fusion gps). disgraced and fired fbi agent peter strzok. this is too crazy to be believed! the rigged witch hunt has zero credibility.turkey has taken advantage of the united states for many years. they are now holding our wonderful christian pastor, who i must now ask to represent our country as a great patriot hostage. we will pay nothing for the release of an innocent man, but we are cutting back on turkey!thank you for the kind words omarosa!                                                                                                       great @cabinet meeting today at the @whitehouse!                                                                                            the queen of soul, aretha franklin, is dead. she was a great woman, with a wonderful gift from god, her voice. she will be missed!          there is nothing that i would want more for our country than true freedom of the press. the fact is that the press is free to write and say anything it wants, but much of what it says is fake news, pushing a political agenda or just plain trying to hurt people. honesty wins!the boston globe, which was sold to the the failing new york times for 1.3 billion dollars (plus 800 million dollars in losses & investment), or 2.1 billion dollars, was then sold by the times for 1 dollar. now the globe is in collusion with other papers on free press. prove it!the fake news media is the opposition party. it is very bad for our great country....but we are winning!                                    our economy is doing better than ever. money is pouring into our cherished dollar like rarely before, companies earnings are higher than ever, inflation is low & business optimism is higher than it has ever been. for the first time in many decades, we are protecting our workers!id strip the whole bunch of them. theyre all corrupt. theyve all abused their power. theyve all betrayed the american people with a political agenda. they tried to steal and influence an election in the united states. @seanhannitymark levin when they had power they didnt stop the russians, the chinese, the north koreans, they funded the iranians & are responsible for the greatest scandal in american history by interfering with our election & trying to undermine the trump campaign and trump presidency.were not going to make america great again, it was never that great. can you believe this is the governor of the highest taxed state in the u.s., andrew cuomo, having a total meltdown!were not gong to make america great again, it was never that great.  can you believe this is the governor of the highest taxed state in the u.s., andrew cuomo, having a total meltdown!hillary clinton clearly got a pass by the fbi. we have the unfortunate situation where they then decided they were going to frame donald trump concerning the rigged witch hunt. joe digenova, former u.s. attorney.john brennan is a stain on the country, we deserve better than this. former secret service agent and author of new book, spygate, the attempted sabotage of donald j. trump, dan bongino. thank you dan, and good luck with the book!rt @rasmussen_poll: todays @realdonaldtrump approval ratings among black voters: 36%

the spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported collusion with russia, because there was no collusion. he was only there to spy for political reasons and to help crooked hillary win - just like they did to bernie sanders, who got duped!if the person placed very early into my campaign wasnt a spy put there by the previous administration for political purposes, how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered - many times higher than normal...for the first time since roe v. wade, america has a pro-life president, a pro-life vice president, a pro-life house of representatives and 25 pro-life republican state capitals!

they have found no collussion with russia, no obstruction, but they arent looking at the corruption...things are really getting ridiculous. the failing and crooked (but not as crooked as hillary clinton) @nytimes has done a long & boring story indicating that the worlds most expensive witch hunt has found nothing on russia & me so now they are looking at the rest of the world!if the fbi or doj was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign, that is a really big deal. only the release or review of documents that the house intelligence committee (also, senate judiciary) is asking for can give the conclusive answers. drain the swamp!great to have our incredible first lady back home in the white house. melania is feeling and doing really well. thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes!great to have our incredible first lady back home in the white house. melanie is feeling and doing really well. thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes!happy #armedforcesday to our great military men and women for their selfless service to our nation!

                                               mexico is doing very little, if not nothing, at stopping people from flowing into mexico through their southern border, and then into the u.s. they laugh at our dumb immigration laws. they must stop the big drug and people flows, or i will stop their cash cow, nafta. need wall!border patrol agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the border because of ridiculous liberal (democrat) laws like catch & release. getting more dangerous. caravans coming. republicans must go to nuclear option to pass tough laws now. no more daca deal!happy easter!

i have stated my concerns with amazon long before the election. unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our postal system as their delivery boy (causing tremendous loss to the u.s.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!....in the interim, hon. robert wilkie of dod will serve as acting secretary. i am thankful for dr. david shulkins service to our country and to our great veterans!i am pleased to announce that i intend to nominate highly respected admiral ronny l. jackson, md, as the new secretary of veterans affairs....great briefing this afternoon on the start of our southern border wall!

press conference:  our nations motto is in god we trust. this week, our nation lost an incredible leader who devoted his life to helping us understand what those words really mean. we will never forget the historic crowds, the voice, the energy, and the profound faith of billy graham! #cpac2018 we salute our great american flag, we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance, and we all proudly stand for the national anthem. #cpac2018 after years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation - and we are restoring our confidence and our pride! #cpac2018 for those of you who are still interested, the democrats have totally forgotten about daca. not a lot of interest on this subject from them!my daughter, ivanka, just arrived in south korea. we cannot have a better, or smarter, person representing our country.                     cpac today!                                                                                                                                 ms-13 gang members are being removed by our great ice and border patrol agents by the thousands, but these killers come back in from el salvador, and through mexico, like water. el salvador just takes our money, and mexico must help more with this problem. we need the wall!school shooting survivor says he quit @cnn town hall after refusing scripted question. @tuckercarlson. just like so much of cnn, fake news. thats why their ratings are so bad! msnbc may be worse.today, it was my great honor to host a school safety roundtable at the @whitehouse with state and local leaders, law enforcement officers, and education officials.

there is nothing more important than protecting our children. they deserve to be safe, and we will deliver! on behalf of an entire nation, congratulations to the u.s. women's hockey team on winning the gold! #goteamusa #olympics                    will be meeting with lawmakers today at 11:30 a.m. to discuss school safety.  next week it will be with our nations governors. its been many years of all talk, no action. well get it done!what many people dont understand, or dont want to understand, is that wayne, chris and the folks who work so hard at the @nra are great people and great american patriots. they love our country and will do the right thing.                  make america great again!i will be strongly pushing comprehensive background checks with an emphasis on mental health. raise age to 21 and end sale of bump stocks! congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - i hope!....if a potential sicko shooter knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will never attack that school. cowards wont go there...problem solved. must be offensive, defense alone wont work!....history shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes. it takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. great deterrent!....immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. far more assets at much less cost than guards. a gun free school is a magnet for bad people. attacks would end!i never said give teachers guns like was stated on fake news @cnn & @nbc. what i said was to look at the possibility of giving concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able toi will always remember the time i spent today with courageous students, teachers and families. so much love in the midst of so much pain. we must not let them down. we must keep our children safe!!

full listening session:  .@flotus melania and i join millions of people around the world in mourning the passing of billy graham. our prayers are with his children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and all who worked closely with reverend graham in his lifelong ministry. yesterday, it was my great honor to recognize extraordinary law enforcement officers and first responders, and to award them the the highest possible decoration for bravery by public safety officers, the medal of valor. #americanheroes question: if all of the russian meddling took place during the obama administration, right up to january 20th, why arent they the subject of the investigation? why didnt obama do something about the meddling? why arent dem crimes under investigation? ask jeff sessions!the great billy graham is dead. there was nobody like him! he will be missed by christians and all religions. a very special man.           question: if all of the russian meddling took place during the obama administration, right up to january 20th, why arent they the subject of the investigation? why didnt obama do something about the meddling? why arent dem crimes under investigation? ask jeff session!@cnn @msnbc whether we are republican or democrat, we must now focus on strengthening background checks!                                    so true, thank you!                                                                                                                         bad ratings @cnn & @msnbc got scammed when they covered the anti-trump russia rally wall-to-wall. they probably knew it was fake news but, because it was a rally against me, they pushed it hard anyway. two really dishonest newscasters, but the public is wise!main street is booming thanks to our incredible tax cut and reform law. "this shows small-business owners are more than just optimistic, they are ready to grow their businesses." ....cameras running. another false accusation. why doesnt @washingtonpost report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me? one had her home mortgage paid off. only @foxnews so reported...doesnt fit the mainstream media narrative.a woman i dont know and, to the best of my knowledge, never met, is on the front page of the fake news washington post saying i kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of trump tower 12 years ago. never happened! who would do this in a public space with live security......i have been much tougher on russia than obama, just look at the facts. total fake news!                                                     hope republicans in the great state of pennsylvania challenge the new pushed congressional map, all the way to the supreme court, if necessary. your original was correct! dont let the dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes & waste money!matt schlapp and cpac are getting ready for another exciting event. big difference from those days when president obama held the white house. youve come a long way matt!republicans are now leading the generic poll, perhaps because of the popular tax cuts which the dems want to take away. actually, they want to raise you taxes, substantially. also, they want to do nothing on daca, rs want to fix!....the president obama quote just before election. thats because he thought crooked hillary was going to win and he didnt want to rock the boat. when i easily won the electoral college, the whole game changed and the russian excuse became the narrative of the dems.there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig americas elections, theres no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time, and so id invite mr. trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes. .....thank you to @foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the obama administration had against russia, including crimea, syria and so much more. we are now starting to win again!the faith of donald trump, a book just out by david brody and scott lamb, is a very interesting read. enjoy!                                the u.s. economy is looking very good, in my opinion, even better than anticipated. companies are pouring back into our country, reversing the long term trend of leaving. the unemployment numbers are looking great, and regulations & taxes have been massively cut! jobs, jobs, jobs.@mittromney has announced he is running for the senate from the wonderful state of utah. he will make a great senator and worthy successor to @orrinhatch, and has my full support and endorsement!obama was president up to, and beyond, the 2016 election. so why didnt he do something about russian meddling?                              have a great, but very reflective, presidents day!                                                                                          just watched a very insecure oprah winfrey, who at one point i knew very well, interview a panel of people on 60 minutes. the questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect. hope oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others!my great friends from nascar are having their big race today, the daytona 500. brian france and the france family are special people. enjoy the race!thank you to kenstarr, former independent counsel, whitewater, for your insight and powerful words on fisa abuse, russian meddling etc. really great interview with @mariabartiromogreat pollster john mclaughlin now has the gop up in the generic congressional ballot. big gain over last 4 weeks. i guess people are loving the big tax cuts given them by the republicans, the cuts the dems want to take away. we need more republicans!the fake news of big ratings loser cnn.                                                                                                     if it was the goal of russia to create discord, disruption and chaos within the u.s. then, with all of the committee hearings, investigations and party hatred, they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. they are laughing their asses off in moscow. get smart america!rt @mike_pence: big night. largest-ever dallas county gop reagan day dinner. as i told the crowd, under president @realdonaldtrump: promise now that adam schiff is starting to blame president obama for russian meddling in the election, he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the democrats, lead by their fearless leader, crooked hillary clinton, lost the 2016 election. but wasnt i a great candidate?i never said russia did not meddle in the election, i said it may be russia, or china or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer. the russian hoax was that the trump campaign colluded with russia - it never did!finally, liddle adam schiff, the leakin monster of no control, is now blaming the obama administration for russian meddling in the 2016 election. he is finally right about something. obama was president, knew of the threat, and did nothing. thank you adam!never gotten over the fact that obama was able to send $1.7 billion dollars in cash to iran and nobody in congress, the fbi or justice called for an investigation!general mcmaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the russians and that the only collusion was between russia and crooked h, the dnc and the dems. remember the dirty dossier, uranium, speeches, emails and the podesta company!very sad that the fbi missed all of the many signals sent out by the florida school shooter. this is not acceptable. they are spending too much time trying to prove russian collusion with the trump campaign - there is no collusion. get back to the basics and make us all proud!just like they dont want to solve the daca problem, why didnt the democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the house & senate during the obama administration. because they didnt want to, and now they just talk!i have seen all of the russian ads and i can say very definitively that swaying the election was *not* the main goal.
rob goldman
vice president of facebook ads the fake news media never fails. hard to ignore this fact from the vice president of facebook ads, rob goldman!                             funny how the fake news media doesnt want to say that the russian group was formed in 2014, long before my run for president. maybe they knew i was going to run even though i didnt know!deputy a.g. rod rosenstein stated at the news conference: there is no allegation in the indictment that any american was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. there is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.charges deal don a big win, written by michael goodwin of the @nypost, succinctly states that the russians had no impact on the election results. there was no collusion with the trump campaign. she lost the old-fashioned way, by being a terrible candidate. case closed.melania and i met such incredible people last night in broward county, florida. will never forget them, or the evening!                     our entire nation, w/one heavy heart, continues to pray for the victims & their families in parkland, fl. to teachers, law enforcement, first responders & medical professionals who responded so bravely in the face of danger: we thank you for your courage!  russia started their anti-us campaign in 2014, long before i announced that i would run for president. the results of the election were not impacted. the trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!cannot believe how badly daca recipients have been treated by the democrats...totally abandoned! republicans are still working hard.        i will be leaving for florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth - but people whose lives have been totally shattered. am also working with congress on many fronts.presidential proclamation honoring the victims of the tragedy in parkland, florida:                                                         ...lottery, continues deadly catch-and-release, and bars enforcement even for future illegal immigrants. voting for this amendment would be a vote against law enforcement, and a vote for open borders. if dems are actually serious about daca, they should support the grassley bill!the schumer-rounds-collins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe. @dhsgov says it would be the end of immigration enforcement in america. it creates a giant amnesty (including for dangerous criminals), doesnt build the wall, expands chain migration, keeps the visa...rt @spoxdhs: schumer-rounds-collins destroys the ability of @dhsgov to enforce immigration laws, creating a mass amnesty for over 10 millio in times of tragedy, the bonds that sustain us are those of family, faith, community, and country. these bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil - and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need.  while the republicans and democrats in congress are working hard to come up with a solution to daca, they should be strongly considering a system of merit based immigration so that we will have the people ready, willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the usa!so many signs that the florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!just spoke to governor rick scott. we are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible florida school shooting.                     my prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible florida shooting. no child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an american school.today, i was honored to be joined by republicans and democrats from both the house and senate, as well as members of my cabinet - to discuss the urgent need to rebuild and restore americas depleted infrastructure.  as we come together to celebrate the extraordinary contributions of african-americans to our nation, our thoughts turn to the heroes of the civil rights movement whose courage and sacrifice have inspired us all. proclamation:  negotiations on daca have begun. republicans want to make a deal and democrats say they want to make a deal. wouldnt it be great if we could finally, after so many years, solve the daca puzzle. this will be our last chance, there will never be another opportunity! march 5th.our infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except, of course, the democrats. after many years we have taken care of our military, now we have to fix our roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and more. bipartisan, make deal dems?the journey to #maga began @cpac 2011 and the opportunity to reconnect with friends and supporters is something i look forward to every year. see you at #cpac2018!thank you to sue kruczek, who lost her wonderful and talented son nick to the opioid scourge, for your kind words while on @foxandfriends. we are fighting this terrible epidemic hard - nick will not have died in vain!this will be a big week for infrastructure. after so stupidly spending $7 trillion in the middle east, it is now time to start investing in our country!just spoke to @johnkasich to express condolences and prayers to all for the horrible shooting of two great police officers from @westervillepd. this is a true tragedy!rep. lou barletta, a great republican from pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters, will make a fantastic senator. he is strong & smart, loves pennsylvania & loves our country! voted for tax cuts, unlike bob casey, who listened to tax hikers pelosi and schumer!4.2 million hard working americans have already received a large bonus and/or pay increase because of our recently passed tax cut & jobs bill....and it will only get better! we are far ahead of schedule.so many positive things going on for the u.s.a. and the fake news media just doesnt want to go there. same negative stories over and over again! no wonder the people no longer trust the media, whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history!    #magamy administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe, modern and lawful immigration system: fully securing the border, ending chain migration, and canceling the visa lottery. congress must secure the immigration system and protect americans. my thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers, their families, and everybody at the @westervillepd.                              republicans want to fix daca far more than the democrats do. the dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011, and they decided not to do anything about daca. they only want to use it as a campaign issue. vote republican!....agencies, not just the fbi & doj, now the state department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the election. comey had conversations with donald trump, which i dont believe were accurate...he leaked information (corrupt). tom fitton of judicial watch on @foxnewsmy view is that not only has trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the dossier and the lies about the clinton/dnc dossier, it shows that hes been victimized. hes been victimized by the obama administration who were using all sorts of.......peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. some are true and some are false. some are old and some are new. there is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. is there no such thing any longer as due process?according to the @nytimes, a russian sold phony secrets on trump to the u.s. asking price was $10 million, brought down to $1 million to be paid over time. i hope people are now seeing & understanding what is going on here. it is all now starting to come out - drain the swamp!the democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew, because of sources and methods (and more), would have to be heavily redacted, whereupon they would blame the white house for lack of transparency. told them to re-do and send back in proper form!jobless claims have dropped to a 45 year low!                                                                                               costs on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more republicans in the 2018 election, and beyond. this bill is a big victory for our military, but much waste in order to get dem votes. fortunately, daca not included in this bill, negotiations to start now!without more republicans in congress, we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally, after many years of depletion, take care of our military. sadly, we needed some dem votes for passage. must elect more republicans in 2018 election!just signed bill. our military will now be stronger than ever before. we love and need our military and gave them everything  and more. first time this has happened in a long time. also means jobs, jobs, jobs!wow! -senator mark warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a russian oligarch. warner did not want a paper trail on a private meeting (in london) he requested with steele of fraudulent dossier fame. all tied into crooked hillary.time to end the visa lottery. congress must secure the immigration system and protect americans.                                            as long as we open our eyes to gods grace - and open our hearts to gods love - then america will forever be the land of the free, the home of the brave, and a light unto all nations. #nationalprayerbreakfast i will be meeting with henry kissinger at 1:45pm. will be discussing north korea, china and the middle east.                                our founders invoked our creator four times in the declaration of independence. our currency declares in god we trust. and we place our hands on our hearts as we recite the pledge of allegiance and proclaim that we are one nation under god. #nationalprayerbreakfast will be heading over shortly to make remarks at the national prayer breakfast in washington. great religious and political leaders, and many friends, including t.v. producer mark burnett of our wonderful 14 season apprentice triumph, will be there. looking forward to seeing all!the budget agreement today is so important for our great military. it ends the dangerous sequester and gives secretary mattis what he needs to keep america great. republicans and democrats must support our troops and support this bill!congratulations to the republic of korea on what will be a magnificent winter olympics! what the south korean people have built is truly an inspiration! best wishes to the republic of korea on hosting the @olympics! what a wonderful opportunity to show everyone that you are a truly great nation! new fbi texts are bombshells!                                                                                                               in the old days, when good news was reported, the stock market would go up. today, when good news is reported, the stock market goes down. big mistake, and we have so much good (great) news about the economy!congratulations @elonmusk and @spacex on the successful #falconheavy launch. this achievement, along with @nasas commercial and international partners, continues to show american ingenuity at its best! happy birthday to our 40th president of the united states of america, ronald reagan!                                                        today, we heard the experiences of law enforcement professionals and community leaders working to combat the threat of ms-13, and the reforms we need from congress to defeat it. watch here:  we need a 21st century merit-based immigration system.  chain migration and the visa lottery are outdated programs that hurt our economic and national security. polling shows nearly 7 in 10 americans support an immigration reform package that includes daca, fully secures the border, ends chain migration & cancels the visa lottery. if ds oppose this deal, they arent serious about daca-they just want open borders. my prayers and best wishes are with the family of edwin jackson, a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken. @colts          so disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed @colts linebacker edwin jackson. this is just one of many such preventable tragedies. we must get the dems to get tough on the border, and with illegal immigration, fast!thanks to the historic tax cuts that i signed into law, your paychecks are going way up, your taxes are going way down, and america is once again open for business! representative devin nunes, a man of tremendous courage and grit, may someday be recognized as a great american hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure!any deal on daca that does not include strong border security and the desperately needed wall is a total waste of time. march 5th is rapidly approaching and the dems seem not to care about daca. make a deal!little adam schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in washington, right up there with comey, warner, brennan and clapper! adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. must be stopped!thank you to @foxandfriends for exposing the truth. perhaps thats why your ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition!  the democrats are pushing for universal healthcare while thousands of people are marching in the uk because their u system is going broke and not working. dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care. no thanks!congratulations to the philadelphia eagles on a great super bowl victory!                                                                   my thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims involved in this mornings train collision in south carolina. thank you to our incredible first responders for the work theyve done!...a tool of anti-trump political actors. this is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to alarm anyone who wants the fbi to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the law....the fbi wasnt straight with congress, as it hid most of these facts from investigators. wall street journalthe four page memo released friday reports the disturbing fact about how the fbi and fisa appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermath....the fbi failed to inform the fisa court that the clinton campaign had funded the dossier....the fbi became....great jobs numbers and finally, after many years, rising wages- and nobody even talks about them. only russia, russia, russia, despite the fact that, after a year of looking, there is no collusion!this memo totally vindicates trump in probe. but the russian witch hunt goes on and on. their was no collusion and there was no obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding nothing, collusion is dead). this is an american disgrace!rasmussen just announced that my approval rating jumped to 49%, a far better number than i had in winning the election, and higher than certain sacred cows. other trump polls are way up also. so why does the media refuse to write this? oh well, someday!rt @erictrump: #makeamericagreatagain                                                                                                       rt @erictrump:                                                                                                                              today, it was my honor to join the great men and women of @dhsgov, @customsborder, @icegov and @uscis at the u.s. customs and border protection national targeting center in sterling, virginia. fact sheet:  trump the orator outlines the greatness of america to democrats disgust                                                                     with 3.5 million americans receiving bonuses or other benefits from their employers as a result of tax cuts, 2018 is off to great start!

#maga you had hillary clinton and the democratic party try to hide the fact that they gave money to gps fusion to create a dossier which was used by their allies in the obama administration to convince a court misleadingly, by all accounts, to spy on the trump team. tom fitton, jwthe top leadership and investigators of the fbi and the justice department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of democrats and against republicans - something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago. rank & file are great people!the democrats just arent calling about daca. nancy pelosi and chuck schumer have to get moving fast, or theyll disappoint you again. we have a great chance to make a deal or, blame the dems! march 5th is coming up fast.thank you for all of the nice compliments and reviews on the state of the union speech. 45.6 million people watched, the highest number in history. @foxnews beat every other network, for the first time ever, with 11.7 million people tuning in. delivered from the heart!march 5th is rapidly approaching and the democrats are doing nothing about daca. they resist, blame, complain and obstruct - and do nothing. start pushing nancy pelosi and the dems to work out a daca fix, now!heading to beautiful west virginia to be with great members of the republican party. will be planning infrastructure and discussing immigration and daca, not easy when we have no support from the democrats. not one dem voted for our tax cut bill! need more republicans in 18.join me live for the #sotu

great news as toyota and mazda announce they are bringing 4,000 jobs and investing $1.6 billion in alabama, helping to further grow our economy! the united states needs the security of the wall on the southern border, which must be part of any daca approval. the safety and security of our country is #1! today, it was my great honor to welcome prime minister erna solberg of norway to the @whitehouse - a great friend and ally of the united states! joint press conference:  i want to thank my @cabinet for working tirelessly on behalf of our country. 2017 was a year of monumental achievement and we look forward to the year ahead. together, we are delivering results and making america great again!  the single greatest witch hunt in american history continues. there was no collusion, everybody including the dems knows there was no collusion, & yet on and on it goes. russia & the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing. republicans should finally take control!the fact that sneaky dianne feinstein, who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between trump/russia has not been found, would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way, totally without authorization, is a disgrace. must have tough primary!it just shows everyone how broken and unfair our court system is when the opposing side in a case (such as daca) always runs to the 9th circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts..@icegov hsi agents and ero officers, on behalf of an entire nation, thank you for what you are doing 24/7/365 to keep fellow americans safe. everyone is so grateful!
