# Deep Learning in Data Science - DD2424
This repository contains my code for solving the assignments in the Deep Learning - DD2424 Course

## Contents:

* **Assignment 1:** Train and evaluate a *single layer neural network* in order to
classify images from the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset.

* **Assignment 2:** Add a second layer to the neural network built in the previous assignment. Implement methods to find good parameter settings for the network's regularization and learning rate.
